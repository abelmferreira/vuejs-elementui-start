# vujs-elementui-start
Simple interface using Vuejs, vex, vue-router, element-ui with protected routes, login page, messages system and responsive menu

This app was created to be used as an initial basis for other projects.

Was build with Vue-cli 3 with pwa, vuex and vue-router.

Uses element-ui for styles and has a responsive menu (non-existent in element-ui components)

It has a simple layer to protect routes that need authentication.

And small helper for sending notifications messages to user with vuex and element-ui
